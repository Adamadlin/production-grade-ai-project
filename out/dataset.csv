Local information The first place users should look to is whatever local information is available. Through man pages and help output, many uses of tools will be seen. Remember to just run man tool-name or tool-name --help when you’re unsure of a certain flag and you should be good. However, what if you don’t know at all what a tool is used for, and you don’t learn much from either resource? Online information If man pages and help output didn’t answer questions, then perhaps kali.org/tools/ will be of assistance. With use case examples, the man page/help output, and descriptions for the tool, there is a lot of information to be gained by looking at a tool. Additionally, each tool’s page links to the upstream website which may provide additional information for the tool.

Example domains As described in RFC 2606 and RFC 6761 , a number of domains such as example.com and example.org are maintained for documentation purposes. These domains may be used as illustrative examples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are not available for registration or transfer.
